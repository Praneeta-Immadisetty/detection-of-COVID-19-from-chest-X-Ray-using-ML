# detection-of-COVID-19-from-chest-X-Ray-using-ML
This project detects COVID-19 positive or negative from Chest X-Rays scans using CNN model

In this work, we have considered the following datasets for the execution:

For Covid-19 positive cases X-Ray Image Dataset
  -  https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset

For normal X-Ray Image Dataset from Kaggle
  -  https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

On Training the model, the validation accuracy is 96.67%.
